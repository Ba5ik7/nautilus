Project Nautilus
==========================
This is a fork of [how-to-sane](https://github.com/mgenev/how-to-sane) which keeps the same Sails server, but replaces the Ember client with Aurelia for the sake of a side by side comparison.


Currently demonstrated features:
 - Geo service for Google Maps

Open to contributors
